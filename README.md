### Local Setup

You should have Python 3.9 installed on your system. You can get the latest version from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You should also have [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/), a virtual environment manager for Python. It will ensure that you download the required dependencies in a virtual environment and not globally.

``` terminal
pip install --user pipenv
```

Here is how you can set up the entire project on your system from the command line:

``` terminal
git clone https://github.com/Tashi21/Movieflix.git
cd movieflix
